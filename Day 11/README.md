# Day 11: Introduction to HTML Entities and Code Tags

In today's lesson, I learnt about HTML entities and code tags.

## HTML Entities

HTML entities are special characters that cannot be directly used in HTML code. Instead, we use entity references to display these characters correctly. Here are some commonly used entities:

- `&lt;` represents the less-than symbol (<).
- `&gt;` represents the greater-than symbol (>).
- `&amp;` represents the ampersand symbol (&).
- `&quot;` represents the double quotation mark (").
- `&apos;` represents the single quotation mark (').

## Code Tags

Code tags are used to display code snippets or inline code within HTML documents. To use code tags, wrap your code with `<code>` tags.
