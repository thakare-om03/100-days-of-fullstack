# 100 Days of Fullstack

Welcome to my 100 Days of Fullstack coding journey! In this repository, I will be documenting my daily progress as I dive into the world of full-stack development. 

## About

This repository serves as a chronicle of my learnings and code snippets over the course of 100 days. Each day's folder contains a README file summarizing what I have learned and the corresponding code.

## Goals

My main goals for this challenge are:

- Master front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Gain proficiency in back-end technologies like Node.js, Express, and databases.
- Build full-stack applications to solidify my understanding and skills.
