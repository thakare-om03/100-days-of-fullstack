## Day 19: CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders

Today, I learned about the CSS Box Model! It's a way to control how boxes (which make up all the things on a webpage) are spaced out.

* First, there's the **content box** in the center. This is where the actual stuff you see on the page lives, like text and pictures.
* Around the content box, there's something called **padding**. It's like a fluffy border that adds space between the content and the edge of the box.
* Then there's the **border** itself. This is the line you see around the box (and the padding if you added it). It can be any color or style you want!
* Finally, there's some empty space outside the whole thing called the **margin**. This separates one box from another box, giving them some breathing room.

I learned special words to control each part:

* **`margin`** for the space outside the box
* **`padding`** for the fluffy space inside
* **`border`** for the line around the box (you can pick the color and style!)
