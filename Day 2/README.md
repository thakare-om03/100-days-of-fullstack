# Day 2: Building a Basic Bookmark Manager

Today, I took yesterday's basics made a Basic bookmark manager!

## Learnings

HTML for Structure: I explored using `<h2>` tags to create subheadings, allowing me to categorize my bookmarks for better readability.

Enhanced User Experience: I implemented the `target="_blank"` attribute for links, making them open in new tabs and preventing accidental page closures.
