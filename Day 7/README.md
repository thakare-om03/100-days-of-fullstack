# Day 7: Adding Videos, Photos, and Audio to HTML

Today, I learned about adding videos, photos, and audio to HTML. These multimedia elements enhance the user experience and make web pages more engaging.

## Videos

To add a video to an HTML page, you can use the `<video>` element.

## Photos

To add photos to an HTML page, you can use the `<img>` element.

## Audio

To add audio to an HTML page, you can use the `<audio>` element.
