## Day 16: Diving Deeper into CSS

Today I learned about different ways to style web pages with CSS! I covered three main methods:

## Inline CSS
I learned how to style elements directly within the HTML code using the `style` attribute. This is handy for quick one-off changes, but not ideal for larger projects.

## Internal CSS
I discovered how to create styles within the `<head>` section of an HTML document using the `<style>` tag. This is useful for keeping styles organized for a single webpage.

## External CSS
Finally, I explored using external CSS files. This is the most recommended approach, as it separates styles from HTML for better maintainability and reusability across multiple webpages.
